## Overview  

As a bit of background, this project was build as a part of our third module at the Flatiron School. Our project requirements were that we create our first full stack application using a Rails backend and a Javascript frontend. As a team, we both decided we were passionate about travel and want to create a website for a small travel agency.

This site allows a user to make a reservation request for a given number of activities that the agency offeres trips for.

Trips are split up by the countries that those trips occur in.
